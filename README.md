# NumPy Learning
Welcome to my NumPy Learning repository! This repo contains tutorials, notes, and practice scripts designed to help me (and others) understand and use **NumPy** â€” the essential Python library for numerical and array computing.

## Whatâ€™s inside?
- Introduction to NumPy basics: arrays, data types, and array creation  
- Array indexing, slicing, and iteration  
- Mathematical operations and broadcasting  
- Working with shapes and reshaping arrays  
- Useful NumPy functions and utilities  
- Sample projects and exercises

## Who is this for?
- Beginners who want to learn NumPy from scratch  
- Python programmers interested in data science, machine learning, or scientific computing  
- Anyone wanting to improve their numerical computing skills with Python

## How to use?
- Browse the notebooks and Python scripts in the folder  
- Run the code locally or modify it for your own experiments  
- Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements via pull requests!

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy (install via `pip install numpy`)
